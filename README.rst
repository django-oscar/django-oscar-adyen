This package provides integration with the `Adyen`_ payment gateway. It is
designed to work seamlessly with the e-commerce framework `django-oscar`_, but
can be used without Oscar. This extension supports Django 1.6+, Python 2.7+ and
Oscar 1.0+.

.. _`django-oscar`: https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar


Installation
============

Get it from PyPi::

    $ pip install django-oscar-adyen


Add ``'adyen'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and run::

    $ django-admin migrate adyen

to create the appropriate database tables.

Configuration
=============

You have two approaches to configure `django-oscar-adyen`.

Settings-based configuration
----------------------------
For simple deployments, setting the required values in the settings will suffice.

Edit your ``settings.py`` to set the following settings:

* ``ADYEN_IDENTIFIER`` - The identifier of your Adyen account.
* ``ADYEN_SKIN_CODE`` -  The code for your Adyen skin.
* ``ADYEN_SECRET_KEY`` - The secret key defined in your Adyen skin.
* ``ADYEN_ACTION_URL`` -
  The URL towards which the Adyen form should be POSTed to initiate the payment process
  (e.g. 'https://test.adyen.com/hpp/select.shtml').
* ``ADYEN_IP_ADDRESS_HTTP_HEADER`` - Optional. The header in `META` to inspect to determine
  the IP address of the request. Defaults to `REMOTE_ADDR`.

You will likely need to specify different settings in your test environment
as opposed to your production environment.

Class-based configuration
-------------------------
In more complex deployments, you will want to e.g. alter the Adyen identifier based on
the request. That is not easily implemented with Django settings, so you can alternatively
set ``ADYEN_CONFIG_CLASS`` to a config class of your own.
See `adyen.settings_config.FromSettingsConfig` for an example.
